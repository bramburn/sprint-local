**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

def get_openrouter(model: str = "openai/gpt-4") -> ChatOpenAI:
    return ChatOpenAI(
        model=model,
        openai_api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"],
        openai_api_base="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    )

llm = get_openrouter(model="gpt-4")
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Using incorrect API base URL
- Forgetting to set the API key

**Examples:**
```python
# Using a different model
llm = get_openrouter(model="anthropic/claude-2")
```

```python
import time
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def execute_chain(question):
    try:
        return chain.run(question=question)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        raise
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Infinite retry loops
- Not logging errors for debugging

### 6. Optimize for Performance

Consider performance optimizations to reduce latency and improve user experience.[8]

```python
for chunk in llm.stream("Hello, how are you?"):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```
- Implement caching for frequently asked questions

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Over-optimization leading to increased complexity
- Not considering the trade-offs between speed and accuracy

### 7. Implement Logging and Monitoring

Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring to track usage, errors, and performance metrics.[6]

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def log_interaction(question, answer):
    logger.info(f"Q: {question}")
    logger.info(f"A: {answer}")
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Logging sensitive information
- Overwhelming logs with unnecessary details

### 8. Stay Updated with LangChain and OpenRouter Changes

- Learn how to integrate prompt templates for structured outputs.
- Explore best practices for implementation, error handling, and performance optimization.

### Target Audience:
- Junior to senior-level SWEs with basic Python knowledge.
- Engineers familiar with AI concepts and language models.

---

## II. Best Practices

### **1. Understand the Core Components of LangChain Agents**

**Description:**
LangChain agents consist of the following key components:
- **Prompt Template:** Defines the structure of the input prompt.
- **LLM (Language Model):** Powers the agent's reasoning engine.
- **Tools:** External utilities or APIs the agent can invoke.
- **Agent Executor:** Manages the interaction between the agent, tools, and user input.

**Rationale:**
Breaking down these components helps modularize development and simplifies debugging.

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use prebuilt tools or create custom ones based on your requirements.
- Start with a simple agent and gradually add complexity.

**Resources:**
- LangChain documentation on [Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/overview).

---

### **2. Design a Prompt Template**

**Description:**
A prompt template structures the input for the LLM, ensuring clarity and consistency.

**Rationale:**
Well-designed templates improve model performance by providing clear instructions and context.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """You are an assistant that provides concise answers.
Question: {question}
Answer:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Overloading prompts with unnecessary details.
- Hardcoding values instead of using placeholders for flexibility.

**Examples:**
```python
response = prompt.format(question="What is the capital of France?")
print(response)  # Output: "You are an assistant that provides concise answers.\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer:"
```

---

### **3. Build an Agent with Structured Outputs**

**Description:**
Agents can return structured outputs (e.g., JSON) for downstream processing.

**Rationale:**
Structured outputs ensure consistency and simplify integration with other systems.

**Implementation Tips:**
1. Define a schema using Pydantic:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResponseSchema(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(description="The final answer to the user's question")
    sources: list[str] = Field(description="List of sources used")
```

2. Bind the schema to the model:
```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4")
model_with_schema = llm.with_structured_output(ResponseSchema)
```

3. Use the model in an agent:
```python
response = model_with_schema.invoke("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Forgetting to validate outputs against the schema.
- Using overly complex schemas that slow down processing.

**Examples:**
Structured output for a Q&A system:
```json
{
  "answer": "Paris",
  "sources": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"]
}
```

---

### **4. Combine Components into an Agent Executor**

**Description:**
The Agent Executor orchestrates interactions between prompts, tools, and models.

**Rationale:**
It simplifies complex workflows by automating tool usage and response generation.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Define tools (e.g., search API)
tools = [...]  # List of tool objects

# Create a prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("user", "{input}")
])

# Initialize an agent executor
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=prompt, tools=tools)

# Run the agent
response = agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What is 5 + 3?"})
print(response)
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Not properly configuring tool inputs/outputs.
- Overloading agents with unnecessary tools.

---

### **5. Implement Error Handling**

**Description:**
Handle errors gracefully to ensure reliability during runtime.

**Rationale:**
Robust error handling prevents crashes and improves user experience.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=10))
def safe_execute(agent_executor, input_data):
    try:
        return agent_executor.invoke(input_data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        raise
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Infinite retry loops without backoff strategies.
- Not logging errors for debugging purposes.

---

### **6. Optimize Agent Performance**

**Description:**
Optimize agents for speed and resource efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

**Rationale:**
Efficient agents reduce latency and operating costs in production environments.

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use streaming responses for faster initial outputs:
```python
for chunk in llm.stream("What is 5 + 3?"):
    print(chunk.content, end="")
```
- Cache results for frequently asked questions.
- Limit token usage by refining prompts.

---

### **7. Test and Iterate**

**Description:**

# Best Practices for Chaining Prompt Outputs in LangChain

## I. Introduction

This guide provides software development engineers (SWEs) with best practices for chaining the output of one LangChain prompt into another without full context of the previous code. It is designed for SWEs of all experience levels, focusing on clear, concise, and practical advice.

### Objectives:
- Understand the concept of prompt chaining in LangChain
- Learn best practices for efficient and effective prompt chaining
- Implement robust and scalable solutions using LangChain

### Target Audience:
- Junior to senior-level SWEs
- Familiarity with Python and basic LangChain concepts is assumed

## II. Best Practices

### 1. Use RunnableSequence for Efficient Chaining

**Description:**
RunnableSequence allows you to chain multiple components together, passing the output of one as input to the next.

**Rationale:**
It provides a clean and efficient way to create complex chains without manually managing intermediate outputs.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableSequence
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

prompt1 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize this: {input}")
prompt2 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Translate to French: {input}")
model = ChatOpenAI()

chain = RunnableSequence(
    prompt1,
    model,
    prompt2,
    model
)

result = chain.invoke({"input": "Hello, world!"})
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Overcomplicating chains with too many steps
- Not handling errors that may occur in intermediate steps

**Resources:**
- [LangChain RunnableSequence Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/how_to/map)

### 2. Leverage the Pipe Operator for Concise Chaining

**Description:**
The pipe operator (`|`) in LangChain allows for a more concise way to chain components.

**Rationale:**
It simplifies the code and makes the chain more readable, especially for longer sequences.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser

prompt1 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize: {input}")
prompt2 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Translate to French: {input}")
model = ChatOpenAI()

chain = prompt1 | model | StrOutputParser() | prompt2 | model | StrOutputParser()

result = chain.invoke({"input": "Hello, world!"})
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Forgetting to parse outputs between steps
- Mismatching input/output types between chained components

### 3. Use RunnablePassthrough for Preserving Original Input

**Description:**
RunnablePassthrough allows you to pass the original input alongside transformed data through the chain.

**Rationale:**
It's useful when you need to reference the original input in later steps of the chain.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough

chain = {
    "original": RunnablePassthrough(),
    "summary": prompt1 | model | StrOutputParser(),
} | prompt2 | model

result = chain.invoke({"input": "Hello, world!"})
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Overusing passthroughs and creating overly complex data structures
- Forgetting to handle the passthrough data in subsequent steps

### 4. Implement Error Handling and Retries

**Description:**
Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms to deal with potential failures in the chain.

**Rationale:**
Ensures the chain can recover from temporary errors and provides better reliability.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableRetry

retry_chain = RunnableRetry(
    chain,
    max_attempts=3,
    wait_exponential_jitter=True
)

try:
    result = retry_chain.invoke({"input": "Hello, world!"})
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Chain failed after retries: {e}")
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Not setting appropriate retry limits
- Failing to log errors for debugging purposes

### 5. Use Structured Outputs for Complex Chains

**Description:**
Define structured outputs using Pydantic models to ensure consistency in data passed between chain steps.

**Rationale:**
Provides type safety and clear expectations for the output of each step in the chain.

**Implementation Tips:**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SummaryOutput(BaseModel):
    summary: str

class TranslationOutput(BaseModel):
    translation: str

prompt1 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize: {input}")
prompt2 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Translate to French: {summary}")

chain = (
    prompt1 
    | model 
    | SummaryOutput 
    | prompt2 
    | model 
    | TranslationOutput
)

result = chain.invoke({"input": "Hello, world!"})
```

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Overcomplicating output structures
- Not handling potential parsing errors

**Resources:**
- [Pydantic Documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)

## III. Conclusion

Effective prompt chaining in LangChain requires a good understanding of the available tools and best practices. Key takeaways include:

1. Use RunnableSequence or the pipe operator for clean and efficient chaining
2. Leverage RunnablePassthrough when original input needs to be preserved
3. Implement robust error handling and retries
4. Use structured outputs for complex chains to ensure consistency

We encourage readers to provide feedback and share their experiences with these practices. As LangChain and the field of AI continue to evolve, staying updated with the latest developments and continuously refining your skills is crucial for success.

Certainly! Here's a real-world example of chaining multiple prompts in LangChain:

Prompt chaining is a powerful technique in LangChain that involves linking multiple prompts in a logical sequence, where the output of one prompt serves as the input for the next. This modular approach is particularly useful for solving complex tasks like multistep text processing, summarization, and question-answering.[7]

Let's consider a practical example of using prompt chaining to create a content generation pipeline for a blog post:

1. Topic Generation:
```python
topic_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["industry"],
    template="Generate 5 trending blog post topics for the {industry} industry."
)
```

2. Outline Creation:
```python
outline_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["topic"],
    template="Create a detailed outline for a blog post on the topic: {topic}"
)
```

3. Content Writing:
```python
content_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["outline"],
    template="Write a 500-word blog post based on the following outline:\n{outline}"
)
```

4. SEO Optimization:
```python
seo_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["content"],
    template="Optimize the following blog post content for SEO:\n{content}"
)
```

Now, let's chain these prompts together:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChain

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

topic_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=topic_prompt)
outline_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=outline_prompt)
content_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=content_prompt)
seo_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=seo_prompt)

blog_post_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(
    chains=[topic_chain, outline_chain, content_chain, seo_chain],
    verbose=True
)

final_blog_post = blog_post_chain.run("technology")
```

In this example, we've created a modular workflow using LangChain's prompt chaining capabilities. The output of each step serves as the input for the next, allowing us to generate a fully-formed, SEO-optimized blog post from just an industry keyword. This approach leverages LangChain's structured prompts and dynamic chaining to create a scalable and adaptive pipeline for content generation.[7]

This real-world example demonstrates how prompt chaining in LangChain can be used to break down complex tasks into manageable steps, each handled by a specialized prompt, resulting in a more efficient and effective workflow.
