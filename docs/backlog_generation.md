# Backlog Generation

## Overview
The backlog generation feature allows you to generate a structured backlog from a natural language prompt. This tool helps developers quickly break down complex features or projects into actionable tasks.

## Usage

### CLI Command
```bash
# Generate a backlog and display it in the terminal
sprint generate-backlog "Add user authentication"

# Save the backlog to a file
sprint generate-backlog "Add user authentication" -o backlog.md
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from backlog_generator import BacklogGenerator

# Create a backlog generator
generator = BacklogGenerator()

# Generate a backlog from a prompt
backlog = generator.generate_backlog("Implement machine learning recommendation system")
print(backlog)
```

## Configuration
You can customize the backlog generation by modifying the task templates in `config.py`. The default templates include:
- Implement {feature}
- Test {feature}
- Document {feature}
- Design {feature} Architecture
- Create Acceptance Criteria for {feature}

## Advanced Usage
### Custom Task Templates
```python
config = {
    'backlog_task_templates': [
        "Research {feature}",
        "Prototype {feature}",
        "Validate {feature}"
    ]
}
generator = BacklogGenerator(config)
backlog = generator.generate_backlog("Develop AI chatbot")
```

## Methods
- `parse_prompt(prompt)`: Extracts key information from the input prompt
- `generate_tasks(parsed_prompt)`: Creates a list of tasks based on the parsed prompt
- `format_backlog(tasks)`: Formats the tasks into a structured markdown backlog

## Best Practices
1. Use clear, concise language in your prompts
2. Focus on the core feature or problem you want to solve
3. Experiment with different prompt phrasings to get the most comprehensive backlog

## Limitations
- The backlog generation is based on predefined templates
- Complex or highly specialized tasks may require manual refinement
