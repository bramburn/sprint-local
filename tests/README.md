# Navigator Agent Testing Suite

## Overview
This testing suite provides comprehensive validation for the Navigator Agent system, covering unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Located in `tests/unit/`
- `test_solutions_subagent.py`: Validates solution generation logic
- `test_reflection_subagent.py`: Tests reflection and improvement mechanisms
- `test_analysis_subagent.py`: Checks error analysis and diagnostic capabilities

### 2. Integration Tests
Located in `tests/integration/`
- `test_navigator_workflow.py`: Validates end-to-end workflow execution
  - Complete workflow testing
  - Problem complexity handling
  - Error recovery mechanisms

### 3. Performance Tests
Located in `tests/performance/`
- `test_agent_performance.py`: Measures system performance
  - Execution time tracking
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Scalability assessment
  - Token usage analysis

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Poetry for dependency management
- OpenAI API Key

### Execution Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run specific test category
poetry run pytest tests/unit/
poetry run pytest tests/integration/
poetry run pytest tests/performance/

# Detailed test output
poetry run pytest -v

# Generate coverage report
poetry run pytest --cov=src
```

## Test Configuration
- Uses `pytest` as the testing framework
- `memory_profiler` for memory usage tracking
- Configurable via `pyproject.toml`

## Best Practices
- Each test focuses on a specific behavior
- Tests are independent and repeatable
- Comprehensive error handling validation
- Performance and scalability considerations

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add more edge case tests
- [ ] Implement property-based testing
- [ ] Create more complex scenario simulations
