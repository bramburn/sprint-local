    â”œâ”€â”€ test_main.py
    â””â”€â”€ test_utils/
        â””â”€â”€ test_helper.py
```

**Task:**
Add a new function to `helper.py` that processes data from `config.py`.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Navigate to `project/src/utils/`.
2. Open `helper.py` and review the existing functions.
3. Open `config.py` to understand the data format.
4. Add a new function in `helper.py` that reads data from `config.py`.
5. Test the new function by running `test_helper.py` in `project/tests/test_utils/`.
6. If tests pass, commit changes and push to the repository.

#### Example 2

**Directory List:**
```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service1.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service2.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ db/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ database.py
â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

**Task:**
Implement a new service in `services/` to handle user authentication.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Navigate to `project/src/services/`.
2. Create a new file `auth_service.py`.
3. In `auth_service.py`, implement user authentication logic.
4. Modify `app.py` to integrate the new `auth_service.py`.
5. Update `database.py` to include any necessary schema changes for user authentication.
6. Document the new service in `project/docs/README.md`.
7. Test the new service and commit changes.

#### Example 3

**Directory List:**
```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ include/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ headers.h
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ library.cpp
â””â”€â”€ bin/
    â””â”€â”€ executable
```

**Task:**
Optimize the performance of `main.cpp` using functions from `library.cpp`.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Navigate to `project/src/`.
2. Open `main.cpp` and identify performance bottlenecks.
3. Open `library.cpp` and review available optimization functions.
4. Implement optimizations in `main.cpp` using functions from `library.cpp`.
5. Recompile and run the `executable` in `project/bin/` to test performance improvements.
6. Document changes and commit to the repository.

### AI Messages:
- **Plan of Action: Adding a New AI Provider to Cline Dropdown**

**Step 1: Analyze the Project Structure**

* Navigate to `project/src/` and review the directory structure.
* Identify the relevant files and directories related to the Cline dropdown, such as `cline.py` and `models/`.
* Note the existing AI providers and their corresponding code in `models/`.

**Step 2: Understand the Task Requirements**

* Review the task requirements to understand the new AI provider's functionality and integration requirements.
* Identify any specific dependencies or libraries required for the new AI provider.

**Step 3: Design the New AI Provider**

* Create a new file `new_ai_provider.py` in `project/src/models/` to define the new AI provider's functionality.
* Implement the necessary logic for the new AI provider, including data processing and model training.
* Ensure the new AI provider is compatible with the existing Cline dropdown framework.

**Step 4: Integrate the New AI Provider**

* Modify `cline.py` to include the new AI provider as an option in the dropdown menu.
* Update the `models` module to include the new AI provider's configuration and initialization code.
* Test the new AI provider by running `test_cline.py` in `project/tests/`.

**Step 5: Test and Refine**

* Test the new AI provider thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.
* Refine the implementation as needed to optimize performance and accuracy.
* Document the new AI provider's functionality and integration process.

**Step 6: Commit and Deploy**

* Commit the changes to the repository and push them to the remote server.
* Deploy the updated code to the production environment.
* Test the new AI provider in the production environment to ensure it functions as expected.

**Step 7: Monitor and Maintain**

* Monitor the new AI provider's performance and accuracy in the production environment.
* Gather feedback from users and make any necessary adjustments to the implementation.
* Continuously test and refine the new AI provider to ensure it remains a reliable and effective solution.

**Timeline:**

* Step 1: Analyze project structure and task requirements (1 hour)
* Step 2: Design the new AI provider (2 hours)
* Step 3: Integrate the new AI provider (3 hours)
* Step 4: Test and refine the new AI provider (4 hours)
* Step 5: Commit and deploy the changes (1 hour)
* Step 6: Monitor and maintain the new AI provider (Ongoing)

**Resources:**

* Python 3.x
* Cline framework
* New AI provider library or framework (if applicable)
* Test environment (e.g., Docker, virtual machine)

**Assumptions:**

* The new AI provider is compatible with the existing Cline dropdown framework.
* The necessary dependencies and libraries are available and installed.
* The project's codebase is well-organized and maintainable....
