- [human] AI: Human: ### Purpose

You are an expert developer tasked with analyzing the structure of a coding project and creating a detailed plan of action to execute a specific coding task.

Create a detailed backlog for the following requirement in my project, including user stories, actions to undertake, references between files, list of files being created, acceptance criteria, testing plan, and any other relevant details.

The backlog should include the following elements:

1. **User Story**: Write a clear and concise user story that describes the desired functionality or feature, including the user's role, goal, and expected outcome.
2. **Actions to Undertake**: Break down the user story into specific, actionable tasks that need to be completed to deliver the desired functionality. These tasks should be described in detail, including any necessary steps, inputs, and outputs.
3. **References between Files**: Identify any relationships or dependencies between files that will be created as part of the project, including data flows, APIs, or other integrations.
4. **List of Files being Created**: Provide a comprehensive list of all files that will be created as part of the project, including code files, documentation files, and any other relevant artifacts.
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear and measurable acceptance criteria for each user story, including any specific requirements or constraints that must be met.
6. **Testing Plan**: Describe the testing approach and methodology that will be used to validate the acceptance criteria, including any test cases, test data, and testing tools.
7. **Assumptions and Dependencies**: Identify any assumptions or dependencies that are being made as part of the project, including any external dependencies or third-party libraries.
8. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Describe any non-functional requirements that are relevant to the project, including performance, security, or usability considerations.

The backlog should be written in a clear and concise manner, with proper formatting and headings to facilitate easy reading and understanding.

Please include the following sections in the backlog:

* **Introduction**
* **User Stories**
* **Actions to Undertake**
* **References between Files**
* **List of Files being Created**
* **Acceptance Criteria**
