    â”œâ”€â”€ test_main.py
    â””â”€â”€ test_utils/
        â””â”€â”€ test_helper.py
```

**Task:**
Add a new function to `helper.py` that processes data from `config.py`.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Navigate to `project/src/utils/`.
2. Open `helper.py` and review the existing functions.
3. Open `config.py` to understand the data format.
4. Add a new function in `helper.py` that reads data from `config.py`.
5. Test the new function by running `test_helper.py` in `project/tests/test_utils/`.
6. If tests pass, commit changes and push to the repository.

#### Example 2

**Directory List:**
```

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ database.py
â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

**Task:**
Implement a new service in `services/` to handle user authentication.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Navigate to `project/src/services/`.
2. Create a new file `auth_service.py`.
3. In `auth_service.py`, implement user authentication logic.
4. Modify `app.py` to integrate the new `auth_service.py`.
5. Update `database.py` to include any necessary schema changes for user authentication.
6. Document the new service in `project/docs/README.md`.
7. Test the new service and commit changes.

#### Example 3

**Directory List:**

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ library.cpp
â””â”€â”€ bin/
    â””â”€â”€ executable
```

**Task:**
Optimize the performance of `main.cpp` using functions from `library.cpp`.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Navigate to `project/src/`.
2. Open `main.cpp` and identify performance bottlenecks.
3. Open `library.cpp` and review available optimization functions.
4. Implement optimizations in `main.cpp` using functions from `library.cpp`.
5. Recompile and run the `executable` in `project/bin/` to test performance improvements.
6. Document changes and commit to the repository.

### User Prompt

Your plan of action:
...
- [ai] AI: ### Plan of Action: Add a New AI Provider to Cline Dropdown

#### Step 1: Navigate to `project/src/utils/`

Navigate to the `utils` directory in the `project` directory to access the `helper.py` file where the new AI provider function will be added.

#### Step 2: Review the existing functions in `helper.py`

Open `helper.py` and review the existing functions to understand the coding style and structure of the file.

#### Step 3: Open `config.py` to understand the data format

Open `config.py` to understand the data format that the new AI provider function will be reading from. This will help in determining the data structure and types that the function will process.

#### Step 4: Add a new function in `helper.py` that reads data from `config.py`

Add a new function in `helper.py` that reads data from `config.py`. The function should be named according to the task, for example, `get_ai_provider`.

```python
# src/utils/helper.py
def get_ai_provider():
    # Read data from config.py
    config = import config
    ai_provider = config.ai_provider
    return ai_provider
```

#### Step 5: Test the new function by running `test_helper.py` in `project/tests/test_utils/`

Run the tests in `project/tests/test_utils/` to ensure the new function works as expected. Test the function with different inputs and verify that it returns the correct output.

#### Step 6: If tests pass, commit changes and push to the repository

If the tests pass, commit the changes to the repository and push them to the remote repository. This will ensure that the new function is available for future use.

#### Step 7: Update the Cline dropdown to use the new AI provider

Update the Cline dropdown to use the new AI provider function. This may involve adding code to the Cline dropdown codebase that calls the `get_ai_provider` function and uses its output to populate the dropdown.

#### Step 8: Test the updated Cline dropdown

Test the updated Cline dropdown to ensure that it is working correctly and displaying the correct AI providers.

#### Step 9: Document the changes

Document the changes made to the codebase, including the new function and the updated Cline dropdown. This will help future developers understand how the code works and make it easier to maintain the codebase.

### Additional Tasks

* Create a new section in the `README.md` file to document the new AI provider functionality.
* Consider adding a new configuration option to allow the user to select the AI provider.
* Update the code to handle any errors that may occur when retrieving the AI provider data.

By following these steps, you can successfully add a new AI provider to the Cline dropdown....
