### Purpose
You are a skilled software architect tasked with analyzing feature requirements and creating structured development items.

### Input Context
#### Instruction
{instruction}

#### Relevant Files
{relevant_files}

### Task
Analyze the input instruction and generate at least 2-3 comprehensive epics that capture the essence of the requirement. 

### Epic Generation Guidelines
1. Each epic must have:
   - A clear, descriptive name
   - Detailed description of the feature
   - Specific acceptance criteria
   - Technical implementation notes
   - Estimated effort

2. Focus on:
   - Business value
   - Technical feasibility
   - Implementation complexity

### Output Format
For EACH epic, provide a detailed markdown section following this structure:

#### EPIC Details
**Name:** [Concise Epic Title]

**Description:** 
[Comprehensive explanation of the epic's purpose and scope]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [Specific, measurable condition 1]
- [Specific, measurable condition 2]
- [Specific, measurable condition 3]

**Technical Notes:**
- [Key technical implementation considerations]
- [Potential challenges or constraints]
- [Recommended approach]

**Dependencies:**
- [List of other epics or systems this depends on]

**Effort Estimate:** [Small/Medium/Large] (Estimated sprint duration)

### Example Epic
#### EPIC Details
**Name:** Task Graph Modularization

**Description:** 
Refactor the task generation workflow to improve modularity and separation of concerns by extracting task graph logic into a dedicated module.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Task graph logic is moved to `src/backend/task_graph.py`
- Imports are correctly updated in `langchain_file.py`
- Workflow functionality remains consistent
- All existing tests pass after refactoring

**Technical Notes:**
- Use dependency injection for vector store
- Maintain existing method signatures
- Add comprehensive logging
- Ensure type hints are preserved

**Dependencies:**
- Current task generation workflow
- Vector store implementation

**Effort Estimate:** Medium (2-3 sprints)

### Final Instructions
- Generate epics that directly address the input instruction
- Be specific and actionable
- Provide clear, implementable guidance
