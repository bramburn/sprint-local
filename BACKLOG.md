# Project Epic Generation Backlog

## Introduction
This backlog outlines the requirements and implementation details for the Epic Generation feature in the sprint application. The goal is to create a robust, flexible system for generating project epics based on input instructions and code context.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Epic Generation from Code Context
- **As a** project manager
- **I want** to generate comprehensive project epics automatically
- **So that** I can quickly understand the scope and requirements of a software project

#### Description
The system should analyze code files, vector store, and input instructions to generate meaningful epics that capture the essence of the project requirements.

#### Actions to Undertake
1. Implement vector store-based context retrieval
2. Design prompt templates for epic generation
3. Create structured epic output with metadata
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add flexibility for different input sources

#### References between Files
- `src/backend/epic_graph.py`: Core epic generation logic
- `src/langchain_file.py`: Workflow integration
- `src/vectorstore.py`: Context retrieval
- `src/llm_wrapper.py`: Language model configuration

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Generate at least 1-5 epics per instruction
- Include title, description, and acceptance criteria for each epic
- Retrieve and utilize relevant file contexts
- Handle various input instruction complexities
- Provide meaningful metadata about epic generation

#### Testing Plan
- Unit tests for epic generation components
- Integration tests with different input scenarios
- Performance testing with various instruction lengths
- Error handling and edge case testing

### User Story 2: Timestamped Epic File Generation
- **As a** developer
- **I want** each epic generation to create a uniquely named file
- **So that** I can track and differentiate between different epic generation runs

#### Description
Implement a mechanism to generate markdown files with timestamps to ensure unique identification of epic generation outputs.

#### Actions to Undertake
1. Modify `langchain_file.py` to support timestamp-based filenames
2. Update file saving mechanism
3. Ensure consistent file naming across different components

#### References between Files
- `src/langchain_file.py`: File generation and saving
- `src/backend/epic_graph.py`: Epic output generation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Generate filenames with format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_project_epics.md`
- Save files in the designated output directory
- Maintain existing file content structure
- Handle cases with and without explicit filename

#### Testing Plan
- Verify unique filename generation
- Test file saving under different scenarios
- Check timestamp format and consistency

## List of Files being Created/Modified

### File 1: `src/backend/epic_graph.py`
- **Purpose**: Core logic for epic generation using language models and vector store
- **Contents**: 
  - Epic generation workflow
  - Vector store context retrieval
  - Prompt template management
  - Structured epic output

### File 2: `src/langchain_file.py`
- **Purpose**: Workflow integration and file management for epic generation
- **Contents**:
  - Timestamp-based filename generation
  - File saving mechanisms
  - Workflow coordination

## Assumptions and Dependencies
- OpenAI API or compatible language model available
- Existing vector store implementation
- Python 3.8+ environment
- Poetry dependency management
- Langchain and LangGraph libraries

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Generate epics within 30 seconds
- Scalability: Handle instructions of varying complexity
- Reliability: Robust error handling
- Logging: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Security: Protect API keys and sensitive information

## Testing Approach

### Test Case 1: Basic Epic Generation
- **Description**: Generate epics from a simple instruction
- **Test Data**: Minimal code context, clear instruction
- **Expected Result**: 1-3 well-formed epics
- **Testing Tool**: pytest

### Test Case 2: Complex Instruction Handling
- **Description**: Generate epics from a complex, multi-faceted instruction
- **Test Data**: Multiple code files, intricate requirements
- **Expected Result**: Comprehensive, detailed epics covering all aspects
- **Testing Tool**: pytest

### Test Case 3: Error Scenario Testing
- **Description**: Test epic generation with incomplete or invalid inputs
- **Test Data**: Empty instructions, missing vector store
- **Expected Result**: Graceful error handling, informative logs
- **Testing Tool**: pytest

## Conclusion
This backlog provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing a flexible, context-aware epic generation system that leverages AI and code analysis to support project planning and requirements gathering.
