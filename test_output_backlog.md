    Original Task:
    add a new method that adds a new step to the langgraph state graph that will be used to create a detailed action list from the backlog
    
    Backlog:
    Based on the provided code and task requirements, I will create a detailed product backlog for implementing a user authentication system with login, registration, and password reset features.

**User Stories**

1. **As a user, I want to log in to the system using my email and password so that I can access my account.**
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The login form submits credentials and redirects to dashboard on success.
		+ The system validates the user's credentials (email and password).
2. **As a new user, I want to register for an account using my email so that I can start using the system.**
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The registration form validates the user's email.
		+ The system creates a new user account with the provided email and password.
3. **As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account.**
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The password reset functionality sends a confirmation email to the user's email.
		+ The user can reset their password by following the link in the confirmation email.

**Actions to Undertake**

1. Implement login form with email and password fields.
2. Develop registration form with email validation.
3. Create password reset functionality with email confirmation.
4. Integrate with email service to send confirmation emails.
5. Implement dashboard for users to access their account.
6. Develop user authentication system using LangGraph.
7. Create a detailed action list from the backlog.

**References between Files**

* AuthenticationService.js depends on UserService.js for user data handling.
* UserService.js depends on Database.js for user data storage.

**List of Files being Created**

* AuthenticationService.js
* UserService.js
* Database.js
* auth.html
* auth.css
* login.js
* register.js
* reset.js
* dashboard.js

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. The login form submits credentials and redirects to dashboard on success.
2. The system validates the user's credentials (email and password).
3. The registration form validates the user's email.
4. The system creates a new user account with the provided email and password.
5. The password reset functionality sends a confirmation email to the user's email.
6. The user can reset their password by following the link in the confirmation email.

**Testing Plan**

1. Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
2. Test registration with valid and invalid email formats.
3. Test password reset functionality end-to-end.

**Assumptions and Dependencies**

* Assume email service is already configured.
* Project dependencies include React and Node.js.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

* System should handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
* Passwords must be stored securely using bcrypt.

**Conclusion**

The implementation of the user authentication system will follow the outlined steps, starting with the login feature, followed by registration, and ending with password reset. The next step is to begin development of the login form.

Note: This is a high-level product backlog, and the actual implementation may require additional details and refinement.
