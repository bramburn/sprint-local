# The Developer's Evolved Workflow Story: Lightweight, Context-Aware AI Task Management

## The Core Problem
Developers need a lightweight, phone-friendly way to manage and monitor AI-assisted development that can work with cheaper models, handle multiple objectives effectively, and maintain context across tasks - all while allowing natural conversation and task modification during development.

## Sarah's New Journey

> Sarah is watching TV in the evening but wants to make progress on her project. She pulls out her phone, which connects to her VS Code instance running on her laptop via a QR-coded websocket connection.
> 
> She starts by narrating a high-level epic for a new feature. The system breaks this down into manageable backlogs and tasks, each with their own context and acceptance criteria. As she watches the tasks progress on her phone, she notices a failing test.
> 
> "Oh, I think it needs the themes from the external folder," she thinks, and simply types this insight into the chat. The system immediately pauses its current repair queue, incorporates her suggestion, and continues testing.
> 
> Throughout the evening, she can add new ideas or acceptance criteria as they come to her. The system intelligently prioritizes these additions, either pushing them to the top of the queue or scheduling them appropriately based on dependencies and project context.

## The Innovation

Unlike the original vision, this evolved approach focuses on:

1. **Lightweight Task Management**
   - Works with cheaper models efficiently
   - Breaks down large tasks into smaller, focused objectives
   - Maintains separate contexts per task
   - Allows mobile-first interaction

2. **Dynamic Task Handling**
   - Supports continuous conversation during development
   - Allows task addition and modification on the fly
   - Intelligently queues and prioritizes tasks
   - Manages repair and testing workflows automatically

3. **Specialized Agent Delegation**
   - Uses specific agents for different task types
   - Provides relevant tools based on task context
   - Maintains workflow-specific knowledge
   - Optimizes resource usage by limiting tool exposure

## Key Differentiators

Instead of:
- Sending massive context (10,000-20,000 tokens) upfront
- Requiring complex UI interactions
- Using expensive models exclusively
- Maintaining single-thread conversations

The system:
- Maintains lean, task-specific contexts
- Supports natural chat interaction
- Works with cheaper models effectively
- Manages multiple parallel conversations and tasks
- Allows mobile-first development monitoring

## Success Metrics

The system succeeds when it enables:
- Evening/casual development management
- Natural conversation-based task modification
- Efficient handling of multiple objectives
- Automatic task prioritization and queuing
- Seamless integration of user insights during development
- Mobile-first development monitoring and control

Would you like me to:
1. Detail the task prioritization system?
2. Elaborate on the agent delegation mechanism?
3. Explore the mobile interaction patterns?
4. Describe the testing and repair workflows?
